# Custom "New" Menu

A custom "New" submenu on the context menu.

I do a lot of tests/experiments, and I'm tired of creating new files/templates everytime I want to try something. To get around this, I've created a submenu to contain all coding releated files.

For more information, you can check this [question](https://superuser.com/questions/1242099/create-a-new-new-submenu-in-context-menu-with-a-custom-name) that I've asked on [SUPER USER](https://superuser.com/).

## Installation

You need to copy `CustomNew` folder to your `Windows` directory (e.g. `C:\Windows`). Then run `install.reg` that's inside the CustomNew folder. If you're familiar with Registry Keys and Batch files, you can modify the submenu to meet your needs.
